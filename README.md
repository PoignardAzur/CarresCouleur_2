CarresCouleur_2 is a very simple game coded in a few weeks to try out the game engine I had built for my SpaceInvaders game. I have remade said engine from the ground up several times, and this is the second game with moving multicolored sqaures is built to test it.

Its main features are a menu/level system, and a bunch of moving entities.
